            <div class="col-xs-6">One of the many video games I play is fortnite. In fortnite there is a ranked mode
              known as arena which you play matches in to gain or lose points based on if you win the game or not, and
              however many players you eliminate to rank up into new divisions. If you get 6000 or more arena points
              then you have reached something known as Champions League in which you can either continue to play more
              games in order to get more points and try to have the very most, or you can compete in tournaments for
              cash </div>
            <div class="col-xs-6">prizes or to gain more said arena points as of last season(a game rotation that causes
              arena points to reset, and adds more content to be added to the game,and in this season they added a
              marvel collaboration) I had 11,000 arena points and had came top 20 in a non cash prize tournament with
              over 100,000 players playing in it. If you dont like to play competitively then there are many other
              options for you too such as fun new gamemodes that change every week and unranked games.</div>

      <h4>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-xs-5 jumbotron text-center">Another video game I play is known as Valorant. The game itself
            takes after two of the most popular games of all time, Counter Strike Global Offensive, or CS:GO, which is
            an fps, tactical shooter game, and Overwatch, which is a game where you choose Heroes and use their special
            abilities and weapons to do do things like capture the hardpoint and escort the vehicle. In valorant you
            choose your Character from 11 and use their abilites to either attack or defend a "bomb site," if you are
            attacking, you want to be able to win by planting the "spike" or bomb on the bomb site and it exploding or
            by killing all members of the enemy team.</div>
          <div class="col-xs-7 jumbotron text-center"> If you are on the defender side then you want to wipe out the
            attackers, not letting the bomb be planted within the 1 minute 40 second round period, or by defusing the
            bomb before it blows up. The sides rotate every 12 rounds and the first team to get to 13 round wins first
            wins. There are 2 main gamemodes to valorant, one being unrated, and the second being competitive. In
            competitive there are 22 ranks you can achieve by winning matches in the 4 maps, or battlefields.. There are
            8 main ranks, iron, bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, immortal, and Radiant, radiant being the
            highest, and iron being the lowest. There are 3 subcatigories for each rank, for example diamond 1, diamond
            2, and diamond 3, in order to "rank up" you must go from 1 to 3 and rank up from there to the next rank
            which you restart at 1. This applies to all except for Radiant which is the best rank you can achieve. My
            rank is platinum 3.</div>

      <h2>
        <p> <span style="color:white"> Warzone </span> </p>
      </h2>
      <h4>
        Warzone is one of the many COD or Call of Duty games, but unlike almost all of the other COD games it is a
        Battle Royal, like Fortnite where you jump off a plane, and land down at an area of your choosing in the map
        known as verdansk, and there is a moving zone of poisonous gas that you have to travel away from, whether you be
        on foot, in a car, or in a helicopter. When you land you can find an assortment of Weapons, money, ammunition,
        and explosives. If you are luck enough when you loot around the area, you can find things known as UAVs, and
        Self-Revive Kits, UAVs reveal every player in a wide radius on your map, and a Self-revive kit allows you to
        revive yourself after getting "knocked" without the help of a teamate. These can also be purchased with money at
        the Buy Stations all around the map. You can use money to buy all sorts of things such as gas masks, missile
        strikes, or even something know as a Loadout drop marker, in which you can build your own weapon classes, where
        you can change an assortment of things, such as the weapons you use, and the attachments they have on them. Your
        target: to win, how: be the last man out of 150 standing, and dont get caught in the zone, because it means
        almost certain death if you are in there too long.
